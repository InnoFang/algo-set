# 27. Remove Element

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green.svg)

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example:**

> Given **nums** = [3,2,2,3], **val** = 3,
>
> Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of _nums_ being 2.
