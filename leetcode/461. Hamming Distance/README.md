The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 2^31.

**Example:**

    Input: x = 1, y = 4

    Output: 2

    Explanation:
    1   (0 0 0 1)
    4   (0 1 0 0)

    The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
