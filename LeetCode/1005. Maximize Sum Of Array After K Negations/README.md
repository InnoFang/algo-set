Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, modify the array in the following way:

+ choose an index `i` and replace `nums[i]` with `-nums[i]`.

You should apply this process exactly `k` times. You may choose the same index `i` multiple times.

Return *the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,3], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose index 1 and nums becomes [4,-2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,-1,0,2], k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and nums becomes [3,1,0,2].
```

**xample 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], k = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and nums becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].
```Â 

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
 + `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
 + `1 <= k <= 10^4`
