You are given an array of `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` and each `starti` is **unique**.

The **right interval** for an interval `i` is an interval `j` such that `startj >= endi` and `startj` is **minimized**. Note that `i` may equal `j`.

Return *an array of **right interval** indices for each interval `i`*. If no **right interval** exists for interval `i`, then put `-1` at index `i`.

**Example 1:**

    Input: intervals = [[1,2]]
    Output: [-1]
    Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.

**Example 2:**

    Input: intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]
    Output: [-1,0,1]
    Explanation: There is no right interval for [3,4].
    The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
    The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.

**Example 3:**

    Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
    Output: [-1,2,-1]
    Explanation: There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
    The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= intervals.length <= 2 * 10^4`
 + `intervals[i].length == 2`
 + `-10^6 <= starti <= endi <= 10^6`
 + The start point of each interval is **unique**.
