Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`*.

Â 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
 + `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
 + `0 <= k <= 10^6`
