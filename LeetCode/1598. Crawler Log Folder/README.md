The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a **change folder** operation.

The operations are described below:

 + `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, **remain in the same folder**).
 + `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
 + `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is **guaranteed to always exist**).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `ith` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return *the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations*.

**Example 1:**

    Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/sample_22_1957.png)

    Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]
    Output: 3

**Example 3:**

    Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]
    Output: 0
Â 

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= logs.length <= 10^3`
 + `2 <= logs[i].length <= 10`
 + `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`.
 + `logs[i]` follows the format described in the statement.
 + Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
