Given an integer `n`, return *the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`*.

Note that `n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

 + `0 <= n <= 10^4`
