Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

**Example 1:**

    Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
    Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
    Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

**Example 2:**

    Input: arr = [1,2,3]
    Output: [1,2,3]
    Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
Â 

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
 + `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`
