Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one, which appears **exactly once**. *Find the single element and return it.*


**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
 + `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
 + Each element in `nums` appears exactly **three times** except for one element which appears **once**.
 

**Follow up:** Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
