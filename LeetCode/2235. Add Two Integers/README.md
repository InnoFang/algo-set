Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return *the **sum** of the two integers*.
 

**Example 1:**

    Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
    Output: 17
    Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

**Example 2:**

    Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
    Output: -6
    Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.
 

**Constraints:**

+ `-100 <= num1, num2 <= 100`
