Given a string `s`, return *the length of the longest substring between two equal characters*, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

    Input: s = "aa"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.

**Example 2:**

    Input: s = "abca"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".

**Example 3:**

    Input: s = "cbzxy"
    Output: -1
    Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
Â 

**Constraints:**

+ `1 <= s.length <= 300`
+ `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
