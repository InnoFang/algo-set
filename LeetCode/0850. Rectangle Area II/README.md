You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles. Each `rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2]` denotes the `ith` rectangle where `(xi1, yi1)` are the coordinates of the **bottom-left corner**, and `(xi2, yi2)` are the coordinates of **the top-right corner**.

Calculate the **total area** covered by all `rectangles` in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted **once**.

Return *the **total area***. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

    Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: A total area of 6 is covered by all three rectangles, as illustrated in the picture.
    From (1,1) to (2,2), the green and red rectangles overlap.
    From (1,0) to (2,3), all three rectangles overlap.

**Example 2:**

    Input: rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
    Output: 49
    Explanation: The answer is 1018 modulo (109 + 7), which is 49.

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= rectangles.length <= 200`
 + `rectanges[i].length == 4`
 + `0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 10^9`
