Given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [xi, yi, ai, bi]` represents an axis-aligned rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is `(xi, yi)` and the top-right point of it is `(ai, bi)`.

Return *`true` if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4],[1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,2,3],[1,3,2,4],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[3,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because there is a gap in the top center.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[2,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.
```Â 

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 10^4`
 + `rectangles[i].length == 4`
 + `-10^5 <= xi, yi, ai, bi <= 10^5`
