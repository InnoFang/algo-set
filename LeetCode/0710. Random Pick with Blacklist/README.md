You are given an integer `n` and an array of **unique** integers `blacklist`. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` that is **not** in `blacklist`. Any integer that is in the mentioned range and not in `blacklist` should be **equally likely** to be returned.

Optimize your algorithm such that it minimizes the number of calls to the **built-in** random function of your language.

Implement the `Solution` class:

 + `Solution(int n, int[] blacklist)` Initializes the object with the integer `n` and the blacklisted integers `blacklist`.
 + `int pick()` Returns a random integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` and not in `blacklist`.

**Example 1:**

    Input
    ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
    [[7, [2, 3, 5]], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
    Output
    [null, 0, 4, 1, 6, 1, 0, 4]

    Explanation
    Solution solution = new Solution(7, [2, 3, 5]);
    solution.pick(); // return 0, any integer from [0,1,4,6] should be ok. Note that for every call of pick,
                    // 0, 1, 4, and 6 must be equally likely to be returned (i.e., with probability 1/4).
    solution.pick(); // return 4
    solution.pick(); // return 1
    solution.pick(); // return 6
    solution.pick(); // return 1
    solution.pick(); // return 0
    solution.pick(); // return 4

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= n <= 10^9`
 + `0 <= blacklist.length <= min(10^5, n - 1)`
 + `0 <= blacklist[i] < n`
 + All the values of `blacklist` are unique.
 + At most `2 * 10^4` calls will be made to `pick`.
