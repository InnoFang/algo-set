Given an integer arrayÂ `nums`, return *the number of longest increasing subsequences*.

**Notice** that the sequence has to be **strictly** increasing.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
 + `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
