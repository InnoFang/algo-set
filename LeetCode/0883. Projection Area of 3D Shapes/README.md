You are given an `n x n` `grid` where we place some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes that are axis-aligned with the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of the cell `(i, j)`.

We view the projection of these cubes onto the `xy`, `yz`, and `zx` planes.

A **projection** is like a shadow, that maps our **3-dimensional** figure to a **2-dimensional** plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return *the total area of all three projections*.

**Example 1:**

    Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
    Output: 17
    Explanation: Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.

**Example 2:**

    Input: grid = [[2]]
    Output: 5

**Example 3:**

    Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,2]]
    Output: 8
 

**Constraints:**

 + `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
 + `1 <= n <= 50`
 + `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`
