Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

  1. Search for a node to remove.
  2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:**

    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
    Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
    Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
    One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
    Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

**Example 2:**

    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
    Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
    Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

**Example 3:**

    Input: root = [], key = 0
    Output: []

**Constraints:**

 + The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
 + `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
 + Each node has a **unique** value.
 + `root` is a valid binary search tree.
 + `-10^5 <= key <= 10^5`
