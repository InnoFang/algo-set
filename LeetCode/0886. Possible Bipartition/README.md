We want to split a group of `n` people (labeled from `1` to `n`) into two groups of **any size**. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer `n` and the array `dislikes` where `dislikes[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that the person labeled `ai` does not like the person labeled `bi`, return *`true` if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way*.
Â 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4] and group2 [2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= n <= 2000`
 + `0 <= dislikes.length <= 10^4`
 + `dislikes[i].length == 2`
 + `1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= n`
 + `ai < bi`
 + All the pairs of `dislikes` are unique.
