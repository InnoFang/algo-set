Given an integer `n`, return the `n-th` digit of the infinite integer sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
