In a array `A` of size `2N`, there are `N+1` unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated `N` times.

Return the element repeated N times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
```

**Note:**

 1. `4 <= A.length <= 10000`
 2. `0 <= A[i] < 10000`
 3. `A.length is even`
