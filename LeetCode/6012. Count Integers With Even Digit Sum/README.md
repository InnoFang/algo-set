# [6012. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/count-integers-with-even-digit-sum/)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green.svg)

Given a positive integer `num`, return *the number of positive integers **less than or equal to** `num` whose digit sums are even*.

The **digit sum** of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
```

**Constraints:**

 + 1 <= num <= 1000
