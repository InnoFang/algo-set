Given an integer array `nums`, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return ***any array** that satisfies this condition*.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
    Output: [2,4,3,1]
    Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [0]
    Output: [0]

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
 + `0 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
