Given the `root` of a binary tree, construct a **0-indexed** `m x n` string matrix `res` that represents a **formatted layout** of the tree. The formatted layout matrix should be constructed using the following rules:

 + The **height** of the tree is `height` and the number of rows `m` should be equal to `height + 1`.
 + The number of columns n should be equal to `2^height+1 - 1`.
 + Place the **root node** in the **middle** of the **top row** (more formally, at location `res[0][(n-1)/2]`).
 + For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position `res[r][c]`, place its **left child** at `res[r+1][c-2^(height-r-1)]` and its **right child** at `res[r+1][c+2^(height-r-1)]`.
 + Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.
 + Any empty cells should contain the empty string `""`.

Return *the constructed matrix `res`*.

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print1-tree.jpg)

    Input: root = [1,2]
    Output: 
    [["","1",""],
     ["2","",""]]
**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print2-tree.jpg)

    Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
    Output: 
    [["","","","1","","",""],
     ["","2","","","","3",""],
     ["","","4","","","",""]]
 

**Constraints:**

+ The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2^10]`.
+ `-99 <= Node.val <= 99`
+ The depth of the tree will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
