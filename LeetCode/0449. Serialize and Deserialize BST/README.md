Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

Â 

**Example 1:**

    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: [2,1,3]

**Example 2:**

    Input: root = []
    Output: []

**Constraints:**

 + The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
 + `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
 + The input tree is **guaranteed** to be a binary search tree.
