You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Constraints:**

`1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
