You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return *the maximum **area** of an island in `grid`*. If there is no island, return `0`.Â 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

 + `m == grid.length`
 + `n == grid[i].length`
 + `1 <= m, n <= 50`
 + `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
