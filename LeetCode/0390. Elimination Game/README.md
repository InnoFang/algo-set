You have a list `arr` of all integers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm on `arr`:

 + Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
 + Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
 + Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Given the integer `n`, return *the last number that remains in `arr`*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 6
Explanation:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
arr = [2, 6]
arr = [6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

 + 1 <= n <= 10^9
