Given an `n x n` array of integers `matrix`, return *the **minimum sum** of any **falling path** through `matrix`*.

A **falling path** starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position `(row, col)` will be `(row + 1, col - 1)`, `(row + 1, col)`, or `(row + 1, col + 1)`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[2,1,3],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
Explanation: There are two falling paths with a minimum sum as shown.
```

**Example 2:**

!(https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/failing2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[-19,57],[-40,-5]]
Output: -59
Explanation: The falling path with a minimum sum is shown.
```

**Constraints:**

 + `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
 + `1 <= n <= 100`
 + `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`
