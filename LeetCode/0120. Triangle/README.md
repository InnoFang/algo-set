Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle

    [
         [2],
        [3,4],
       [6,5,7],
      [4,1,8,3]
    ]

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(_n_) extra space, where _n_ is the total number of rows in the triangle.
