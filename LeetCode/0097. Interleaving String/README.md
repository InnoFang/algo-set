Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where they are divided into **non-empty** substrings such that:

 + `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
 + `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
 + `|n - m| <= 1`
 + The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note**: `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

 + `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
 + `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
 + `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?
