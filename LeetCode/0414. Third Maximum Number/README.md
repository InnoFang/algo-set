Given an integer array `nums`, return *the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum** number*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
 + `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
