Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a *leaf value sequence*.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered *leaf-similar* if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

**Note:**

+ Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.q
