You are given two 2D integer arrays, `items1` and `items2`, representing two sets of items. Each array `items` has the following properties:

 + `items[i] = [valuei, weighti]` where `valuei` represents the value and `weighti` represents the **weight** of the `ith` item.
 + The value of each item in `items` is unique.

Return *a 2D integer array `ret` where `ret[i] = [valuei, weighti]`, with `weighti` being the **sum of weights** of all items with value `valuei`*.

**Note:** `ret` should be returned in **ascending** order by value.

**Example 1:**

    Input: items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]
    Output: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
    Explanation: 
    The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.
    The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.
    The item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.  
    Therefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].

**Example 2:**

    Input: items1 = [[1,1],[3,2],[2,3]], items2 = [[2,1],[3,2],[1,3]]
    Output: [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]]
    Explanation: 
    The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 3, total weight = 1 + 3 = 4.
    The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 3 + 1 = 4.
    The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4.
    Therefore, we return [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]].

**Example 3:**

    Input: items1 = [[1,3],[2,2]], items2 = [[7,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
    Output: [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]]
    Explanation:
    The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 4, total weight = 3 + 4 = 7. 
    The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4. 
    The item with value = 7 occurs in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 1.
    Therefore, we return [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]].

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000`
 + `items1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2`
 + `1 <= valuei, weighti <= 1000`
 + Each `valuei` in `items1` is **unique**.
 + Each `valuei` in `items2` is **unique**.
