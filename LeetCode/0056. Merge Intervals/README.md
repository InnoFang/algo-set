Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

 

**Example 1:**

    Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

**Example 2:**

    Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
    Output: [[1,5]]
    Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
 + `intervals[i].length == 2`
 + `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4`
