Given an integer array `queries` and a **positive** integer `intLength`, return *an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is either the `queries[i]th` smallest **positive palindrome** of length `intLength` or `-1` if no such palindrome exists*.

A **palindrome** is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

    Input: queries = [1,2,3,4,5,90], intLength = 3
    Output: [101,111,121,131,141,999]
    Explanation:
    The first few palindromes of length 3 are:
    101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, ...
    The 90th palindrome of length 3 is 999.

**Example 2:**

    Input: queries = [2,4,6], intLength = 4
    Output: [1111,1331,1551]
    Explanation:
    The first six palindromes of length 4 are:
    1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, and 1551.
 
**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`
 + `1 <= queries[i] <= 10^9`
 + `1 <= intLength <= 15`
