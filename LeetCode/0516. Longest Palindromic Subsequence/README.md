Given a string `s`, find *the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in `s`*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
 + `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
