Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a `target` value in an `m x n` integer `matrix`. The `matrix` has the following properties:

 + Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
 + Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/24/searchgrid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

 + `m == matrix.length`
 + `n == matrix[i].length`
 + `1 <= n, m <= 300`
 + `-10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9`
 + All the integers in each row are **sorted** in  + ascending order.
 + All the integers in each column are **sorted** in  + ascending order.
 + `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
