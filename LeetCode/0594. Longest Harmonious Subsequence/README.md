We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences*.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Â 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
 + `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
