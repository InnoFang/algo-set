You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can choose any index `i` where `0 <= i < nums`.length and change `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + x` where x is an integer from the range `[-k, k]`. You can apply this operation **at most once** for each index `i`.

The **score** of `nums` is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in `nums`.

Return *the minimum **score** of `nums` after applying the mentioned operation at most once for each index in it*.

Â 

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [1], k = 0
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The score is max(nums) - min(nums) = 1 - 1 = 0.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [0,10], k = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Change nums to be [2, 8]. The score is max(nums) - min(nums) = 8 - 2 = 6.

**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [1,3,6], k = 3
    Output: 0
    Explanation: Change nums to be [4, 4, 4]. The score is max(nums) - min(nums) = 4 - 4 = 0.

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
 + `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
 + `0 <= k <= 10^4`
