You are given an integer array `score` of size n, where `score[i]` is the score of the `ith` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the `1st` place athlete has the highest score, the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

The `1st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
For the `4th` place to the `nth` place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `x-th` place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the `ith` athlete.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].
```Â 

**Constraints:**

 + `n == score.length`
 + `1 <= n <= 10^4`
 + `0 <= score[i] <= 10^6`
 + All the values in `score` are **unique**.
