You are given an integer array `nums`. The unique elements of an array are the elements that appear **exactly once** in the array.

Return *the **sum** of all the unique elements of `nums`*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,3], and the sum is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no unique elements, and the sum is 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,2,3,4,5], and the sum is 15.
```

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
 + `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
