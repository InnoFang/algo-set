You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an array `widths` denoting **how many pixels wide** each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, `widths[0]` is the width of `'a'`, `widths[1]` is the width of `'b'`, and so on.

You are trying to write `s` across several lines, where **each line is no longer than `100` pixels**. Starting at the beginning of `s`, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed `100` pixels. Then, from where you stopped in `s`, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of `s`.

Return *(an array `result` of length 2 where*(:

 + *`result[0]` is the total number of lines*.
 + *`result[1]` is the width of the last line in pixels*.

**Example 1:**

    Input: widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Output: [3,60]
    Explanation: You can write s as follows:
    abcdefghij  // 100 pixels wide
    klmnopqrst  // 100 pixels wide
    uvwxyz      // 60 pixels wide
    There are a total of 3 lines, and the last line is 60 pixels wide.

**Example 2:**

    Input: widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], s = "bbbcccdddaaa"
    Output: [2,4]
    Explanation: You can write s as follows:
    bbbcccdddaa  // 98 pixels wide
    a            // 4 pixels wide
    There are a total of 2 lines, and the last line is 4 pixels wide.

**Constraints:**

 + `widths.length == 26`
 + `2 <= widths[i] <= 10`
 + `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
 + `s contains only lowercase English letters.
