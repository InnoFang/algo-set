Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a `1` has been removed*.

A subtree of a node `node` is `node` plus every node that is a descendant of `node`.

**Example 1:**

    Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]
    Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
    Explanation: 
    Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
    The diagram on the right represents the answer.

**Example 2:**

    Input: root = [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
    Output: [1,null,1,null,1]

**Example 3:**

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/04/05/1028.png)

    Input: root = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
    Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]

**Constraints:**

 + The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 200]`.
 + `Node.val` is either `0` or `1`.
