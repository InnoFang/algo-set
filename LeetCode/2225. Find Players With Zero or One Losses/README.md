You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that the player `winner_i` defeated player `loser_i` in a match.

Return *a list `answer` of size `2` where*:

 + `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
 + `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

**Note:**

 + You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
 + The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the **same** outcome.
Â 

**Example 1:**

    Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
    Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
    Explanation:
    Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
    Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
    Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
    Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].

**Example 2:**

    Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
    Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
    Explanation:
    Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
    Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
    Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= matches.length <= 10^5`
 + `matches[i].length == 2`
 + `1 <= winneri, loseri <= 10^5`
 + `winneri != loseri`
 + All `matches[i]` are **unique**.
